# Placementapp
Android Project on Placement Application 

Placements management is one of the difficult things which is encountered in any academic organisation. It is difficult to manage all the announcements and all the eligible student's data for many companies, without any particular system dedicated to it. And also manually managing can create a lot of problems for the students as well, as the announcements are not delivered to them properly and many students miss out important conversations. The App proposed now is a one-stop solution for all the problems listed above and provide a comfortable environment for the placement process in the organisation.
